# Introduction

Welcome to NodeScript, a platform designed to simplify workflow automation and API integration processes. NodeScript is designed to help you connect APIs and online services without the need for complex coding. 

NodeScript intuitive visual interface allows you to effortlessly design, manage, and maintain complicated workflows in a format that can be easily shared and collaborated on across teams.

## How does it work?

At its core, NodeScript is a node-based visual programming language that enables users to create flow-based [graphs](./graphs.md), which can then be executed in real-world scenarios through an [endpoint](./endpoints.md).

The functionality and scope of your graph are entirely up to you. NodeScript offers an infinitely scalable canvas that can accommodate as many [nodes](nodes.md) as you need!
