# Getting started

Let's get started with NodeScript. In this section, we'll explore the platform's layout and how to navigate the dashboard. 

NodeScript requires no dependencies, configuration or installation, and will run in any browser.

## Sign in

All we need is your email address, which we'll get through GitHub authentication.

To sign in through GitHub, just click on the option in the top right corner of the landing page and authorize NodeScript to access your GitHub account.


## Dashboard

The Dashboard is the first page you'll see when signing in to NodeScript. It provides an overview and details of the currently selected workspace (1). You can choose from all available workspaces you have access to using the dropdown menu (2). Whenever you select an item from this page, its relevant information appears in the container to its right.

For example, when you click on Graphs in the Workspace navigation (3), a list of all saved graphs in the current workspace will be displayed in the center container (4). Then, if you select a graph from this list, its data will be shown in the right container (5).
