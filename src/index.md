### Visual and collaborative
NodeScript's canvas based interface allows you to quickly understand and modify the logic of your applications, making it easier to collaborate, iterate, and maintain the codebase. Using a visual programming interface accelerates development, promotes collaboration, and empowers a broader range of individuals to participate in the software creation process.

### Real-time results
Receive immediate feedback on the outcomes of your work, quickly identify and correct errors and issues. Real-time results allow you to be more iterative and interactive in your development process. You can make instant adjustments and fine-tune your work, leading to faster progress and more efficient problem-solving. Real-time results also enhance collaboration as they facilitate effective communication and decision-making among team members.

### Modular all the way down
NodeScript is by design optimised for creating and combining nodes. Breaking down a system into independent modules allows for easier maintenance, code reuse, and parallel development. It enables scalability and adaptability by adding, modifying, or replacing modules without disrupting the overall system. Modular software design promotes flexibility, reusability, and maintainability.

# Beta programme
## Welcome to the Beta

Dear Users,

As part of our select group of testers, you're getting a first-hand look at NodeScript during its testing and development period. Remember, NodeScript is still a work in progress, and we're refining and improving it every day. That's where your help comes in! We highly encourage and deeply appreciate any feedback you have that will help us make NodeScript better.

Here are a few key points we want to share as you get started:

- **Executing graphs in the editor is absolutely free:** Feel free to execute your graph as many times as you like while building and testing.

- **Rate Limits:** During this testing period, each workspace is limited to 1000 endpoint invocations per hour. Please note that our rate limits may be subject to change while we fine-tune our system to provide the best performance while maintaining stability.

- **Negotiable Limits:** We understand that everyone's needs are different. If you find yourself needing a higher rate limit, please let us know. We're open to discussion and will do our best to accommodate your needs.

- **Be Creative:** Test the limits and capabilities of the toolset. Use NodeScript to improve an existing project, solve a problem you've been sitting on, or build something totally new.

- **Feedback is Key:** As this is a testing and development period, your insights and experiences are vital to us. Please don't hesitate to share your thoughts, feedback, or any issues you encounter. We also ask you kindly to take part in our exit interview, in which you can share any and all thoughts on the platform.

Additionally, our documentation is available to guide you through the platform and answer any questions you might have. If you need further assistance or have any questions, our support team is always ready to help. You can reach us via email or in our Slack support channel.

We look forward to seeing what you build with NodeScript. Thank you for being an essential part of our journey!
