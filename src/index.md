# Welcome to the NodeScript Beta
## Where a bug can also be a feature...

Dear Users,

As part of our selected group of testers, you're getting a first-hand look at NodeScript during its testing and development period. Remember, NodeScript is still a work in progress, and we're refining and improving it every day. That's where your help comes in! We highly encourage and deeply appreciate any feedback you have that will help us make NodeScript better.

To get started, here is a quick look at what NodeScript can do:
<div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative;">
    <iframe style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" src="" frameborder="3" allowfullscreen>
    </iframe>

### -Super useful and helpful video goes here-

And here are a few key points we want you to keep in mind during this period:
* **Executing graphs in the editor is absolutely free:** Feel free to execute your graph as many times as you like while building and testing.
* **Rate Limits:** During this testing period, each workspace is limited to 1000 endpoint invocations per hour. Please note that our rate limits may be subject to change while we fine-tune our system to provide the best performance while maintaining stability.
* **Negotiable Limits:** We understand that everyone's needs are different. If you find yourself needing a higher rate limit, please let us know. We're open to discussion and will do our best to accommodate your needs.
* **Be Creative:** Test the limits and capabilities of the toolset. Use NodeScript to improve an existing project, solve a problem you've been sitting on, or build something totally new.

Additionally, our documentation is available to guide you through the platform and answer any questions you might have. If you have any further questions, you can reach us in our Slack support channel.

We look forward to seeing what you build with NodeScript. Thank you for being an essential part of our journey!
