# Guides

The guides in this section are intended to give you a jumping off point for your journey with NodeScript to show you what is possible to build. The guides don't serve as an index of all of the nodes that are available, but we will cover some of them as we encounter them in our graphs.

It is highly recommended that you understand the NodeScript [concepts](../concepts) before following these guides, but it is perfectly possible to pick them up as you go.
