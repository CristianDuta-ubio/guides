# Introduction

Welcome to NodeScript, a low-code tool designed to simplify workflow automation and API integration processes.

**Here's what NodeScript can do for you:**

- Connect APIs and online services without the need for complex coding
- Visually design and manage complicated workflows, making them clear and simple to maintain
- Simplify collaboration within your team, with our visual system that is easy to understand and share

## How does it work?

At its core, NodeScript is a node-based visual programming language that enables users to create flow-based [graphs](./graphs.md), which can then be executed in real-world scenarios through an [endpoint](./endpoints.md).

The functionality and scope of your graph are entirely up to you. NodeScript offers an infinitely scalable canvas that can accommodate as many [nodes](nodes.md) as you need!
