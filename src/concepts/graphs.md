# Graphs

Graphs are our canvas for building things. They can contain many nodes, are infinitely scrollable and are the main place you will interact with NodeScript. You can zoom in and out of the graph to orientate yourself.

Graphs consist of connected [nodes](./nodes) - atomic units of computation that take some data via properties, perform a computation and return a result. By combining nodes in a Graph, we can build complex applications of our logic.

Graphs give us:

 - **Instant Feedback** - they are evaluated and the intermediate results are displayed.
 - **Composable** - we can combine many Nodes together.
 - **Reusability** - a graph can be published as a module and allow other graphs to use their functionality.
