# Graphs

Graphs are our canvas for building things in NodeScript. They can contain many connected [nodes](./nodes), each performing a specific task or function. By combining nodes in a Graph, we can build complex applications of our logic. 

You'll use the graph to interact with, create, and manage your workflows or applications by linking nodes in different ways. They are infinitely scrollable and are the main place you will interact with NodeScript. You can zoom in and out of the graph to orientate yourself.

Graphs give us:

 - **Instant Feedback** - they are evaluated and the intermediate results are displayed.
 - **Composable** - we can combine many Nodes together.
 - **Reusability** - a graph can be published as a module and allow other graphs to use their functionality.
